<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Bilyana Ivanova me</h2>

<p> I am a practical, determined person who wants real results, not empty encouragement. I focus a lot on self-improvement—my appearance, my body, my skin, my health—and I ask direct questions because I want clear instructions, especially when money is limited. I can be impatient and sometimes harsh with myself, comparing my looks to others and expecting fast change, which creates frustration. At the same time, I’m persistent: when something matters to me, I keep searching for answers and don’t give up easily. I value honesty over comfort, even when the truth is not flattering, because I’d rather know what is realistically possible than live in illusions.</p>
